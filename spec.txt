As a Java developer at JDoodle, your task is to develop a web app using Spring Boot that tests 
user’s programming knowledge. The app will have a problem bank of at least 10 programming questions, 
each with 5 test cases to validate the answers (stored in a db). 
The app will display 5 random programming problems one by one from the problem bank to the user. 
Once the user submits answers to all the problems, the app will display a detailed result page 
showing what test cases their program passed and failed.

As this is a backend developer role, keep the front end simple.

There are two roles in the application - admin and user. Admins should be able to create problems. 
Users take the tests.

To accomplish this, you'll need to integrate a simple editor that allows users to type and test their programs.
 Once the user submits all their answers, you should use JDoodle's REST API (server to server) to test each 
 answer against the test cases and display the results. (Note: JDoodle has a free API plan).

Feel free to add additional features such as login, saving the results, etc. - it is completely up to 
your imagination and how many features you want to add.


Your solution should include clear documentation of your design decisions, alternative approaches considered, 
and any technical challenges encountered during development. Additionally, you should provide instructions 
on any additional features that you think would enhance the user experience.


You can get inspiration/ideas from JDoodle’s Assignment section and HackerRank.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Please submit by 28th April.

Good luck with the project!
